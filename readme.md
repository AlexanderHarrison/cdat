# CDat

CDat provides a portable, simple, and fast way to read, edit, and modify Melee's DAT files.

## Comparison with [HSDRaw](https://github.com/Ploaj/HSDLib/)
HSDRaw is huge and much more mature than CDat.
It has a GUI for editing DAT files, parsing for every common built-in type,
a viewer and editor for textures and models,
and import and export functionality for common model formats.

However, HSDRaw is extremely buggy and astonishingly slow.
I find a new issue or crash with it every time I try to use it.
The GUI does not work platforms other than Linux,
and it took me a fork and custom code to make the library work on linux.
